Multithreaded C++ / Python Trading Engine
A high-performance, deterministic Limit Order Book (LOB) matching engine built in modern C++17, seamlessly integrated with a Python machine learning backend via Pybind11.

Achieves ~568ns latency and 1.75M+ Operations Per Second (OPS) while guaranteeing ACID-like financial consistency across concurrent trading bots.



🚀 Key Features
Core Matching Engine: Deterministic, multithreaded LOB utilizing C++ STL containers (std::map, std::list, std::unordered_map) to rigorously enforce strict price-time priority.

Thread-Safe Concurrency: Publisher/Subscriber architecture safely managing concurrent market participants (Market Makers, Momentum Traders, ML Snipers) using std::mutex and std::atomic to eliminate race conditions and cross-thread deadlocks.

Embedded Python FFI: Leverages a Pybind11 Foreign Function Interface (FFI) with an embedded CPython interpreter to dynamically instantiate and execute Python-based machine learning modules directly within the low-latency C++ core.

Predictive ML Backend: Python strategy backend evaluating Order Book Imbalance (OBI) and spread width to predict micro-price movements and generate trading signals, allowing rapid iteration without recompiling the core.

Verifiable Simulation: Tick-based deterministic execution loop for tick-by-tick replay, robust unit testing, and algorithmic debugging.

🛠️ Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system before building:

C++ Compiler: Supporting C++17 (e.g., GCC, Clang).

CMake: Version 3.14 or higher.

Python: Python 3.x.

Git: To clone the repository and submodules.




🏗️ Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository with submodules:

Bash
git clone --recursive <https://github.com/TobyMacDonald28/Market-Making-Simulation>
cd Market-Making-Simulation

2. Set up the Python Virtual Environment:

Bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configure and Build the C++ Engine:

Bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make



🏃‍♂️ Running the Simulation
Ensure your virtual environment is active, then run the compiled engine from the build directory:

Bash
source ../venv/bin/activate
./TradingEngine



🧪 Testing
The project includes a suite of unit tests to verify the integrity of the matching engine and trader logic. To run them:

Bash
cd build
./TraderTests
./OrderBookTests
